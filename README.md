# Angela Perez | Data Analyst • Systems Thinker • Quality-Driven Problem Solver  
*From patient care to public data — I translate complexity into clarity.*

## 👩‍⚕️ I Got My Start in Healthcare, But I Don’t Stop There  
For over six years, I worked in clinics and clinical research, where the data was messy, time was short, and accuracy could impact lives.  
Whether coordinating multi-site trials, recruiting for hard-to-fill studies, or managing thousands of data points across EHRs and protocols, I became obsessed with finding the story behind the spreadsheet.

But what started in healthcare has grown into something bigger:  
📊 A passion for **data quality, pattern recognition, and strategic insight** — across any field that needs it.

## 🧠 Why Data Analytics?  
Because real problems don’t sit in tidy dashboards. They hide in inconsistent tables, confusing trends, and siloed systems.  
I love using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Tableau** to transform complex data into actionable insight — whether I’m analyzing:

- Healthcare access and policy trends  
- Public health outcomes  
- Operational inefficiencies  
- Or the next dataset that lands in my lap

## ⚙️ What I Work On  
My GitHub features end-to-end projects in:

- 🔍 **Data Cleaning & Validation** – Because good analysis starts with clean inputs  
- 🏥 **Healthcare Data** – From Medi-Cal trends to birth stats and workforce gaps  
- 📈 **Trend Analysis** – Translating raw data into clear, actionable visuals  
- 📂 **SQL & Spreadsheet Logic** – My go-to tools for slicing complex problems  

My work is rooted in systems thinking, data integrity, and asking better questions — not just finding quick answers.

## 🚀 What’s Next?  
I’m looking for **remote-friendly data roles** (analyst, operations, quality, research) where I can:

✅ Own the cleaning + analysis process  
✅ Make complex data digestible for stakeholders  
✅ Work independently or with a lean, driven team  
✅ Grow beyond healthcare and explore new domains

## 🛠️ Inspired By  
Open public datasets, smart visual design, and any system that still runs on spreadsheets but needs a serious upgrade.
